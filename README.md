OCSF Examples repository contains a collection of sample mappings (raw events to OCSF events), and a collection of demonstrative use-cases of OCSF transformed datasets. 

### Sample Mappings
A vareity of sample mappings can be found in the `/mappings` directory of this repository. The mappings are organized based on the mapping DSL (Domain Specific Language) used for the transfomration. Additionally, a few mappings are provided in a generic markdown file. Sample raw events and corresponding OCSF normalized events can also be found in the /samples sub-directory for each mapping submission.
